> The Monkey application

The Monkey app appears in the main directory of your monkey installation, and is used to launch [[Ted]], the Monkey text editor/IDE found in the monkey 'bin' directory. 

When called with command line parameters, Monkey passes these parameters on to Ted.

On Windows, Monkey also updates itself in the Windows registry if it is a newer version than the version currently registered. In addition, if no registry key is found for the .monkey file extension, one is created and associated with Monkey.

On MacOS, Monkey starts a new instance of Ted if it is called with command line parameters.
