> The GLFW target

GLFW is a free and open source framework for creating native OpenGL apps for Windows and MacOS.

The GLFW site is currently here: [http://www.glfw.org](http://www.glfw.org).

GLFW apps use OpenGL for graphics and OpenAL for audio.

>> Windows Requirements

* [Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads).

* [OpenAL Windows Drivers](http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/oalinst.zip).

>> MacOS Requirements

* [XCode](http://developer.apple.com/xcode) developer tools. XCode is also available via the Mac 'App Store' app.

>> Notes

On Windows, the `MSBUILD_PATH` var in your [[Trans]] config file must be set correctly.

To modify the size and layout of GLFW apps, you will need to modify the app's [[App config settings]].
