> The HTML5 target

HTML5 is an emerging standard for writing web based apps.

>> You will need:

* An HTML5 capable browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari or IE9.

>> Notes

HTML5 apps use a canvas element for graphics rendering. To change the size and layout of this canvas, you will need to modify the MonkeyGame.html and/or main.js files in the app's .build/html5 directory.
