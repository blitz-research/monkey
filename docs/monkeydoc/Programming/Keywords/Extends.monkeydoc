> Keyword Extends

Declares that class definition inherits a parent class.

>> Syntax

Class *Identifier* [ < *Parameters* > ] [ `Extends` *Class* ] [ Implements *Interfaces* ] [ Final ]~n
&nbsp;&nbsp;' Declarations...~n
End [ Class ]

>> Description

The Extends keyword allows a class to 'extend' a parent class, thereby inheriting all of its fields, methods, functions, globals and constants.

This new class can add its own fields, methods, etc, but can also over-ride the existing fields, methods and so on by redefining them.

>> Example

Here we have three classes:

* a base class, Animal, with an 'x' field, a 'legs' field and a 'Move' method;
* the Dog class 'extends' the Animal class, inheriting the x and legs fields and adding its own 'Bark' method;
* the Fly class also extends the Animal class, but over-rides the legs field and Move method, while adding a 'y' field and a 'Buzz' method.

<pre>
Class Animal

	Field x
	Field legs = 4

	Method Move ()
		x = x + 1
	End

End

Class Dog Extends Animal

	Method Bark ()
		Print "Woof"
	End

End

Class Fly Extends Animal

	Field legs = 6
	Field y

	Method Move ()
		x = Rnd (-4, 4)
		y = Rnd (-4, 4)
	End

	Method Buzz ()
		Print "ZzzzZZZzzzzzZZZZ..."
	End

End
</pre>
