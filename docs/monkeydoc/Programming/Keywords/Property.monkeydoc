> Keyword Property

Declares method as property.

>> Syntax

Method *Identifier*: *ReturnType* ( *Parameters* ) [ `Property` ] [ Abstract ] [ Final ]~n
&nbsp;&nbsp;*Statements...*~n
End [ Method ]

>> Description

The Property keyword declares that a method is acting as a class property. Properties are generally used to access a single (usually private) field in a controlled fashion.

Unlike a standard method, a property acts as a proxy for a field, and so can be written to (and read from) using the same syntax as for a field or variable. For example, reading a property:

<pre>
result = myobject.MyProperty
</pre>

*Note that because it's acting like a field, no method-call brackets are required.*

Writing to a property:

<pre>
myobject.MyProperty = value
</pre>

Properties are usually declared in pairs with the same name:

* a 'read' version with no parameters which reads a specific field, and;
* a 'write' version with a single parameter which writes to the same field.

(In the second example above, the value being assigned is the parameter defined in the 'write' property.)

*Properties with multiple parameters cannot use this shortened syntax and must be called in the same way as a standard method.*
