> Directive Extern

External code directive.

>> Syntax

Extern [Private]

>> Description

The Extern directive is used to connect Monkey code to non-Monkey code. It lets you mix Monkey code (to be translated into the target platform language) with native target platform code.

The optional Private modifier can be used to prevent external declarations from being visible outside the current module.

For further information on Extern, please see the Extern section of the monkey language reference.
