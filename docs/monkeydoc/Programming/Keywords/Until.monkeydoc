>> Description

Until marks the end of a Repeat/Until loop; the statements within are repeatedly executed until the expression is true.

The Exit keyword can be used to 'jump out' of the loop, continuing execution after the closing Until.

*An alternative to Repeat/Until is Repeat/Forever, which repeatedly executes the statements within indefinitely.*
