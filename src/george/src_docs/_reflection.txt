# Module reflection

Reflection allows your program to inspect and access all or some of your program's declarations dynamically at runtime.

### Enabling reflection

To enable reflection, you must at least import the reflection module.

In addition, you may provide a 'filter' to limit reflection to a subset of modules using the REFLECTION_FILTER app config setting.

By default, the reflection module will set REFLECTION_FILTER to '*' indicating all modules should be reflected. To override this, you must set REFLECTION_FILTER before importing the reflection module.

Reflection can incur significant overhead, so it's a probably a good idea to only reflect what you really need to.

Here are some examples of using REFLECTION_FILTER:

<pre>
REFLECTION_FILTER="myapp*"                  'only reflect declarations in the main app
REFLECTION_FILTER="myapp\*|mojo\*"            'reflect the main app AND mojo modules
REFLECTION_FILTER="myapp.reflect|mojo\*|os\*" 'reflect myapp.reflect module AND mojo and os modules.
REFLECTION_FILTER="mojo.graphics"           'only reflect mojo.graphics module
</pre>

### Declaration names

Declarations that appear at 'module scope' - that is, declarations that do not appear within a class - are fully qualified by the module they appear in.

For example, the DrawImage function that appears in the mojo.graphics module is named "mojo.graphics.DrawImage".

This is the name returned by the various Name() methods, and is the name you should use with the GetConst, GetGlobal, GetFunction and GetClass functions.

As a convenience, you can also use unqualified names with the Get functions as long as there is only one unique declaration with the given name.

For example, GetFunction( "mojo.graphics.DrawImage" ) and GetFunction( "DrawImage" ) will return the same FunctionInfo object, as long as DrawImage is only declared in one module.

Declarations that appear at class scope are not qualified.

### Box objects

Non-object values of type int, float, string and array must be 'boxed' before they are passed to reflection methods such as SetValue and Invoke.

To do this, use the BoxInt, BoxFloat, BoxString functions. These functions all return a 'box' Object which is suitable for use with SetValue and Invoke.

Similarly, reflection methods such as GetValue and Invoke that return non-object values will return boxed values. 

To unbox these values, use the UnboxInt, UnboxFloat and UnboxString functions.

Here's an example of boxing and unboxing in action:

<pre>
Import reflection

Global MyGlobal:=123

Function Main()

'Get GlobalInfo for MyGlobal 
	Local g:=GetGlobal( "MyGlobal" )

'Read and unbox value of MyGlobal
	Local n1:=UnboxInt( g.GetValue() )

'Print it...
	Print "n1="+n1

'Box and write value of MyGlobal
	g.SetValue( BoxInt( n1*2 ) )

'Read, unbox and dump...
	Local n2:=UnboxInt( g.GetValue() )
	Print "n2="+n2
End
</pre>

Boxing and Unboxing arrays is slightly trickier - you must use the Box and Unbox functions declared in the ArrayBoxer class to do this. Here's an example:

<pre>
Import reflection

Global MyGlobal:Int[]

Function Main()

	'create an int array
	Local intArray:Int[]=[1,2,3,4,5]

	'box it...	
	Local boxedArray:=ArrayBoxer&lt;Int&gt;.Box( intArray )
	
	'set value of MyGlobal
	GetGlobal( "MyGlobal" ).SetValue( boxedArray )
	
	'dump array
	For Local i:=Eachin MyGlobal
		Print i
	Next
	
	'reassign MyGlobal
	MyGlobal=[6,7,8,9,10]
	
	'read value of MyGlobal
	boxedArray=GetGlobal( "MyGlobal" ).GetValue()
	
	'Unbox it...
	intArray=ArrayBoxer&lt;Int&gt;.Unbox( boxedArray )
	
	'dump unboxed array
	For Local i:=Eachin intArray
		Print i
	Next

End
</pre>

# Function BoxBool:Object(value:Bool)

Creates a box object with the given value.

Box objects can be passed to the SetValue methods of FieldInfo and GlobalInfo objects, and used as parameters for the Invoke methods of MethodInfo and FunctionInfo objects.

Box objects are also returned by the GetValue methods of ConstInfo, FieldInfo and GlobalInfo objects, and by the Invoke methods of MethodInfo and FunctionInfo objects.

# Function BoxInt:Object(value:Int)

Creates a box object with the given value.

Box objects can be passed to the SetValue methods of FieldInfo and GlobalInfo objects, and used as parameters for the Invoke methods of MethodInfo and FunctionInfo objects.

Box objects are also returned by the GetValue methods of ConstInfo, FieldInfo and GlobalInfo objects, and by the Invoke methods of MethodInfo and FunctionInfo objects.

[[UnboxInt]]


# Function BoxFloat:Object(value:Float)

Creates a box object with the given value.

Box objects can be passed to the SetValue methods of FieldInfo and GlobalInfo objects, and used as parameters for the Invoke methods of MethodInfo and FunctionInfo objects.

Box objects are also returned by the GetValue methods of ConstInfo, FieldInfo and GlobalInfo objects, and by the Invoke methods of MethodInfo and FunctionInfo objects.

[[UnboxFloat]]


# Function BoxString:Object(value:String)

Creates a box object with the given value.

Box objects can be passed to the SetValue methods of FieldInfo and GlobalInfo objects, and used as parameters for the Invoke methods of MethodInfo and FunctionInfo objects.

# Function UnboxBool:Bool(box:Object)

Unboxes a bool. The box must have been previously created with BoxBool.

[[BoxBool]]


# Function UnboxInt:Int(box:Object)

Unboxes an int. The box must have been previously created with BoxInt.

## See also

[[BoxInt]]


# Function UnboxFloat:Float(box:Object)

[[BoxString]]


# Function BoolClass:ClassInfo()


Returns the class of a 'bool'.

This is actually the class of the objects used to box bools, since bools aren't objects and therefore don't have a class.


# Function IntClass:ClassInfo()

Returns the class of an 'int'.

This is actually the class of the objects used to box ints, since ints aren't objects and therefore don't have a class.


# Function FloatClass:ClassInfo()

Returns the class of a 'float'.

This is actually the class of the objects used to box floats, since floats aren't objects and therefore don't have a class.


# Function StringClass:ClassInfo()

Returns the class of a 'string'.

This is actually the class of the objects used to box strings, since strings aren't objects and therefore don't have a class.


# Function ArrayClass:ClassInfo(elementType:String)

Returns the class of an array.

The elementType parameter is case sensitive, and must be the fully qualified name of the element type.

The elementType parameter may itself be an array, in which case the returned class represents a multidimensional array.

This is actually the class of the objects used to box arrays, since arrays aren't objects and therefore don't have a class.

## Parameters

elementType - Array element type.


# Function GetClasses:ClassInfo[]()
