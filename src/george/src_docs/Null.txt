# Keyword Null

Null is a Monkey constant representing an empty Object reference.

## Syntax

Null represents an empty Object, thereby allowing comparison between Null and an object's handle in order to determine whether or not the object actually exists.

An object's handle may also be set to Null, thereby freeing the object and marking it for garbage collection (assuming no other handles still point to it); however, it is recommended that objects be allowed to go out of scope where possible, rather than nullifying them.
