# Module mojo.input

# Import mojo.keycodes

The input module allows programs to check for user input from a wide variety of devices such keyboards, mice, joysticks and touchsceens.

The input module uses a 'polling' input model, meaning that your program must continually check (or 'poll') the state of input devices. Polling should be performed during the OnUpdate phase of your program.

Please see the [[Key codes]] page for a full list of keyboard, mouse and joystick constants.


# Function EnableKeyboard:Int()

On the android and ios targets, this function enables the native virtual keyboard. On all other targets, both EnableKeyboard and DisableKeyboard have no effect.

A virtual keyboard is a graphical representation of a keyboard overlaid on the display that allows users to enter text by means of touching symbols representing keys.

After enabling the virtual keyboard, you program will be able to use GetChar to receive keystrokes, just as if there were a real keyboard present. It is up to the program to eventually call DisableKeyboard when appropriate, for example, when GetChar returns 13 (ie: the 'Enter' key) or 27 (ie: the 'Esc' key).

On the GLFW, HTML5, Flash and XNA (Windows) targets, keyboard support is always assumed to be available and your program can always use GetChar to receive keystrokes.

On the XNA XBOX and Windows Phone 7 targets, keyboard support is currently unavailable.

# Function DisableKeyboard:Int()

On the android and ios targets, this function disables the native virtual keyboard. On all other targets, both EnableKeyboard and DisableKeyboard have no effect.

# Function KeyDown:Int(key:Int)

Returns 1 if the specified key is currently held down, otherwise 0.

Params: 

key - key code of key to check.

Links: 

[[Key codes]], [[KeyHit]]


# Function KeyHit:Int(key:Int)

Returns the number of times the specified key has been hit since the last OnUpdate.

Note that any on/off style 'buttons' on any device can be read using the KeyDown and KeyHit commands. For example, to read the state of the left mouse button you can use KeyDown( KEY_LMB ) in addition to MouseDown( MOUSE_LEFT ).

Params: 

key - keycode of the key to check.

Example: 

<pre>
Import mojo

Class MyApp Extends App

	Field lineY
			
	Method OnCreate()
		lineY=DeviceHeight()/2
		SetUpdateRate 30
	End
	
	Method OnUpdate()

		Local hit=KeyHit( KEY_LMB )	'Uses KeyHit to check the left mouse button.  You could also use MouseHit( MOUSE_LEFT )
		
		If hit And MouseY()<lineY
			Print "You clicked above the line."
		Else If hit And MouseY()>=lineY
			Print "You clicked on or below the line."
		End
	End
	
	Method OnRender()
		Cls
		DrawLine 0,lineY,DeviceWidth(),lineY
	End
End

Function Main()
	New MyApp
End

# Function PeekChar:Int( index:Int )

Returns the character of the character at the specified index in the keyboard character queue. The character is NOT removed from the keyboard character queue.

If there is no character at the specified index, 0 is returned.


# Function GetChar:Int()

Returns the character code of the next character in the keyboard character queue, or 0 if no more characters are available. The character is removed from the keyboard character queue.

The keyboard queue contains characters codes as opposed to the key codes used by KeyDown and KeyUp. Character codes differ from key codes in that they are generally printable and may be modified by the shift, control and alt keys. Character codes also 'repeat' at a rate determined by the OS.

The mapping from key codes to character codes is controlled by the underlying OS, but in practice will generally map to ASCII codes.

The input module also provides special character code mappings for a number of unprintable keys: 

<pre>
CHAR_TAB
CHAR_BACKSPACE
CHAR_ENTER
CHAR_ESCAPE
CHAR_PAGEUP
CHAR_PAGEDOWN
CHAR_END
CHAR_HOME
CHAR_LEFT
CHAR_UP
CHAR_RIGHT
CHAR_DOWN
CHAR_INSERT
CHAR_DELETE
</pre>

Example: 

<pre>
Import mojo

Class MyApp Extends App

	Field text$="Type something:"

	Method OnCreate()
		SetUpdateRate 30
	End
	
	Method OnUpdate()
		Repeat
			Local char=GetChar()
			If Not char Exit
			If char>=32
				text+=String.FromChar( char )
			Endif
		Forever
	End
	
	Method OnRender()
		Cls
		DrawText text,0,0
	End
End

Function Main()

# Function JoyX:Float(index:Int=0,unit:Int=0)

Returns the x, or horizontal, state of a joystick.

The return value will be in the range -1 to +1, with -1 representing 'left' and +1 representing 'right'.

In the case of controllers with 2 joysticks, the index parameter should be 0 for the left hand joystick, or 1 for the right hand joystick.

Note: On the XNA target, JoyX, JoyY and JoyZ will all return 0 until a joystick button is pressed. This is to comply with xbox live publishing guidelines that state that it must be possible to use any of the 4 controllers to play a game. Mojo will therefore wait until a button is pressed (usually in response to a 'press button to start' style message on the title page) before deciding which controller is in use.

Params: 

index - 0 or 1.


# Function JoyY:Float(index:Int=0,unit:Int=0)

Returns the y, or vertical, state of a joystick.

The return value will be in the range -1 to +1, with -1 representing 'down' and +1 representing 'up'.

In the case of controllers with 2 joysticks, the index parameter should be 0 for the left hand joystick, or 1 for the right hand joystick.

Note: On the XNA target, JoyX, JoyY and JoyZ will all return 0 until a joystick button is pressed. This is to comply with xbox live publishing guidelines that state that it must be possible to use any of the 4 controllers to play a game. Mojo will therefore wait until a button is pressed (usually in response to a 'press button to start' style message on the title page) before deciding which controller is in use.

Params: 

index - 0 or 1.


# Function JoyZ:Float(index:Int=0,unit:Int=0)

On Playstation/Xbox style controllers, JoyZ returns the state of the analog shoulder controls.

The index parameter should be 0 for the left handler shoulder control, or 1 for the right hand shoulder control.

Note: On the XNA target, JoyX, JoyY and JoyZ will all return 0 until a joystick button is pressed. This is to comply with xbox live publishing guidelines that state that it must be possible to use any of the 4 controllers to play a game.
