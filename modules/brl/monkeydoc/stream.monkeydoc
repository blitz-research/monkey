# Module brl.stream

Streams are used to read or write data in a sequential manner. 

Please refer to the [[Stream]] class for more information on using streams.


# Class brl.stream.StreamError Extends Throwable

Common base class for stream exceptions.


# Method GetStream:Stream()

Returns the stream involved in the error.


# Method ToString:String()

Returns a message describing the error.


# Class brl.stream.StreamReadError Extends StreamError

Exception class for stream read errors.


# Class brl.stream.StreamWriteError Extends StreamError

Exception class for stream write errors.


# Class brl.stream.Stream

Streams are used to read or write data in a sequential manner. 

The low level [[Read]] and [[Write]] methods can be used to transfer data directly to/from databuffer objects. These methods return the number of bytes actually transferred, which may be less than requested if an IO error occurs or end-of-file is reached.

The higher level read and write methods will throw a [[StreamReadError]] or [[StreamWriteError]] exception if an IO error occurs or end-file-file is reached during processing.

The [[Eof]] method can be used detect end-of-file status when reading a stream. If this method returns a non-0 value, there is no data left to be read.

Some types of streams are also seekable, meaning they support an internal 'position' variable that controls where data is read/written and may be manually modified.


# Method Eof:Int()

Returns 1 if end-of-file has been reached, -1 if an IO error has occurred or 0 if the stream can be read.


# Method Length:Int()

Returns the stream length if the stream is seekable, else 0.


# Method Position:Int()

Returns the read/write position within the stream if the stream is seekable, else 0.


# Method Seek:Int(position:Int)

If the stream is seekable, adjusts the read/write position within the stream and returns the new read/write position.

Params: 

@position - position to seek to.


# Method Read:Int( buffer:DataBuffer,offset:Int,count:Int )

Reads data from the stream into a databuffer, starting at address @offset within the databuffer.

Returns the number of bytes actually read. This may be less than @count if an IO error occurs or end-of-file has been reached.

If @count is non-zero, this method will block until either at least 1 byte is available to be read, an IO error occurs or end-of-file has been reached.

Params: 

@buffer - destination of stream data.

@offset - start address within @buffer.

@count - number of bytes to transfer.



# Method Write:Int( buffer:DataBuffer,offset:Int,count:Int )

Writes data from a databuffer to the stream, starting at address @offset within the databuffer.

Returns the number of bytes actually written. This will be the same as @count unless an IO error has occured.

This method may block if the underlying stream is full.

Params: 

@buffer - source of stream data.

@offset - start address within @buffer.

@count - number of bytes to transfer.


# Method Close:Void()

Closes the stream and released any OS resources in use.

This method should always be used when you are finished with a stream.


# Method ReadByte:Int()

Reads an 8 bit byte from the stream.

A [[StreamReadError]] will be thrown if a value could not be read.


# Method ReadShort:Int()

Reads a 16 bit int value from the stream.

A [[StreamReadError]] will be thrown if a value could not be read.


# Method ReadInt:Int()

Reads a 32 bit int value from the stream.

A [[StreamReadError]] will be thrown if a value could not be read.


# Method ReadFloat:Float()

Reads a 32 bit float value from the stream.

A [[StreamReadError]] will be thrown if a value could not be read.


# Method WriteByte:Void( value:Int )

Writes an 8 bit byte to the stream.

A [[StreamWriteError]] will be thrown if @value could not be written.


Params: 

@value - value to write.


# Method WriteShort:Void( value:Int )

Write a 16 bit int value to the stream.

A [[StreamWriteError]] will be thrown if @value could not be written.


Params: 

@value - value to write.


# Method WriteInt:Void( value:Int )

Writes a 32 bit int value to the stream.

A [[StreamWriteError]] will be thrown if @value could not be written.


Params: 

@value - value to write.


# Method WriteFloat:Void( value:Float )

Writes a 32 bit float value to the stream.

A [[StreamWriteError]] will be thrown if @value could not be written.


Params: 

@value - value to write.
