NOTE: If you're having trouble with a new version, try deleting '.build' dirs!!!!!

***** V73a *****

Added iaptest to bananas/mak.

Changed default MOJO_AUTO_SUSPEND_ENABLED to true for relevant targets.

Added brl.json module.

Added methods ReadString and WriteString to Stream.

Added methods ReadAll and WriteAll to Stream.

Added brl.monkeystore module.

Added CC_OPTS app config setting for stdcpp target only.

Added XnaGame and XnaDisplayMode classes to xna target:

Class XnaGame

	Function GetXnaGame:XnaGame()
	
	Method GetXnaDesktopMode:XnaDisplayMode()
	Method GetXnaDisplayModes:XnaDisplayMode[]()
	Method SetXnaDisplayMode:Void( width:Int,height:Int,format:Int,fullscreen:Bool )

End

Class XnaDisplayMode
	Field Width:Int
	Field Height:Int
	Field Format:Int	'currently unused, always '1'.
End

eg: XnaGame.GetXnaGame().SetXnaDisplayMode( 1024,768,1,True )	'always use '1' for format for now...

No 'window-less startup' support in XNA.

See bouncyaliens for a demo.


***** V72b *****

Fixed c++ String::ToCString<> mem leak.

Implemented custom https friendly HttpRequest for android, ios, win8, html5, flash.

Fixed trans munging of symbols to ignore case so Java doesn't generate clashing class file on case insensitive file systems.


***** V72a *****

Added GlfwGame and GlfwVideoMode classes to glfw target:

Class GlfwGame

	Function GetGlfwGame:GlfwGame()
	
	Method GetGlfwDesktopMode:GlfwVideoMode()
	Method GetGlfwVideoModes:GlfwVideoMode[]()
	Method SetGlfwWindow:Void( width:Int,height:Int,red:Int,green:Int,blue:Int,alpha:Int,depth:Int,stencil:Int,fullscreen:Bool )
	
End

Class GlfwVideoMode
	Field Width:Int
	Field Height:Int
	Field RedBits:Int
	Field GreenBits:Int
	Field BlueBits:Int
End

eg: GlfwGame.GetGlfwGame().SetGlfwWindow( 1024,768,8,8,8,0,0,0,True )

Glfw mojo images now surive GL context changes.

Set app config settings GLFW_WINDOW_WIDTH and GLFW_WINDOW_HEIGHT to 0 to disable initial graphics window - but make sure to create one using SetGlfwWindow above before OnCreate finishes!


***** V71c *****

Fixed Win8 mouse event handling.

Fixed Win8 device orientation issues.

Added PeekShorts, PokeShorts, PeekInts, PokeInts, PeekFloats, PokeFloats to DataBuffer.


***** V71b *****

Added ReceiveAll and ReceiveAllAsync to Socket for receiving known length messages. ReceiveFrom, Send and SendTo are already implictly 'all'...

Version 1 of WinRT UDP sockets implemented - nasty stuff, may not be 100% right!

Fixed flash Print security exception.

Fixed trans "Unsafe call!!!!!" bug.


***** V71a *****

Update admob SDKs to android=6.4.1, ios=6.4.2.

Removed modules: brl.asyncdataloader, brl.asyncstream, brl.asynctcpstream, brl.asynctcpconnector.

Added DataBuffer.LoadAsync.

Changed brl.httprequest to use a brl.socket under the hood.

Changed brl.tcpstream to use a brl.socket under the hood. 

Added brl.socket for all your tcp/udp needs.

Fixed filestream on stdcpp target.

Fixed win8 tcpstream.

Added CPP_GC_MODE app config setting, one of:

#CPP_GC_MODE=0	'Disable GC
#CPP_GC_MODE=1	'Incremental collect every OnWhatever (default)
#CPP_GC_MODE=2	'Incremental collect every GC allocation (adds some runtime overhead).

CPP_GC_TRIGGER now controls how much memory is allocated before a GC 'sweep' occurs. Increase this for faster GC at the cost of more 'wasted' memory. Defaults to 8M.

Added CPP_GC_MAX_LOCALS app config settings. This is used with GC_MODE 2 to track local object vars and defaults to 8192. Trans uses 445 locals to build itself, so this should be plenty for most apps but if you're doing something very recursive you might want to bump this.

Tweaked makedocs. Can now handle 'relative' imports in .monkey files and added #Rem monkeydoc on/off.


***** V70g *****

Fixed iOS DisableKeyboard not working bug.



***** V70f *****

HttpRequest: Merged devolonter's html5 version addition.

Ted: Console utf8 friendlier.

C++ lang: Print outputs utf8.

Url: Fixed default scheme/port issue.

ios target: Fixed admob not building problem.

MServer: Fixed content type for wav files confusing Firefox.

Android: Fixed ANDRIOD_VERSON_NAME in target config.txt.

Trans: Added debug index checking for String[blah] exprs to cpp/js/as.

Mojo: Added experimental DrawPoly overload with textured image (vertex format is x,y,u,v) - undocced and only available on glfw, ios, android, win8.

Trans: Improved detection of virtual/final etc methods for C++, C# and Java translators.

Trans: Fixed float Mod op bugs.

FileStream: Fixed c++ "u" mode, added "a" for append.

IosGame: Fixed weird virtual keyboard bug.

Ted/Makedocs: Added Alias keyword.

***** V70e *****

Refixed iOS device size issues.


***** V70d *****

Added more keyword docs.

Added win8 multitouch support.

Fixed android manifest VERSION problems.


***** V70c *****

Updated glfw linux makefile.

Fixed bool const evalutor bug in trans.

Fixed Invalid DeviceWidth/DeviceHeight in OnCreate on iOS.

Added ANDROID_VERSION_CODE and ANDROID_VERSION_NAME app config settings.

Fixed winrt threads and winphone8 sockets.

Added Rebuild Help to Ted - can't get QWebPage reload working though, so you'll have to manually right-click/reload the page.

Added Makedocs to rebuildall.bmx/bin.

Added Close Others to Ted.

Added Stack.Sort.

Added brl.filesystem module.

Added Check/Update to Ted's build menu.

Added OnClose and OnBack to mojo App class - on window phone 8, these are the ONLY places you can call EndApp. By default, OnBack calls OnClose and OnClose calls EndApp, so by default back/close will both end an app.

Added EndApp to Mojo. Use this instead of Error "" if you're using Mojo. Error "" still works.

Added monkeydoc as a textfile type to Ted so you get wordwrap.

Html5 Mojo now handles Audio-less DOMs.

Ted rebuilt with Qt4.8.4 on Windows/Mac - tried on Linux: too hard...

Ted console no longer htmlizes app output.

Fixed JoyHit not reseting.

Added temp SaveState_V66b().

Merged mwtb's html5 SetScissor fix.

Merged Devolonter's bananas tweaks.

Added WIN8_PRINT_ENABLED app config var - defaults to 'false', due to apps with print failing 'app store' guidelines.

Added EnabledKeyboard/DisableKeyboard support to windows phone 8 - not yet windows (store?) 8. Note: 'back' on windows phone 8 ALWAYS clears virtual keyboard, whether or not you call DisableKeyboard in response to GetChar()=27. See EnableKeyboard/DisableKeyboard docs for how to handle this.

Fixed Select in generic code causing internal error.

Fixed Android LoadBitmap so it returns Null instead of throwing exception.

Added file path to 'invalid utf8' warning in os.LoadString; rebuilt trans.

Added "screenSize" to android target manifest android:configChanges setting so apps with targetSdkVersion>=12 don't reset when orientation changes.

Merged Ziggy's mserver tweaks.

***** V70b *****

Added temp LoadState_V66b() to Android target for kludging around LoadState issues. If you have recently updated a <v67 app to >=v67, and users have mysteriously 'lost' their save games, you can use this to recover their old save games. However, you might want to let user decide whether to use 'old' or 'new' save game.

Android LoadState now checks for <v67 state data if >=v67 state data not found - my bad, I renamed the state 'key' in v67.


***** V70 *****

Souped up win8 VB performance; fixed several win8 bugs.

Moved all input related constants to mojo.keycodes module.

Put all native code imports inside #If target/lang conditional blocks.

Added some BLAH_IMPLEMENTED checking to extern class decls in brl.

Added InsertBefore, InsertAfter, InsertBeforeEach and InsertAfterEach methods to List.

Semi major Android target change: moved Activity suspend/resume handling code from onSuspend/onResume to onWindowFocusChanged( boolean ).


***** V69 *****

Added WIN8_SCREEN_ORIENTATION app config setting; use a bitwise OR of: 1=Portrait, 2=Landscape, 4=Portrait flipped, 8=Landscape flipped.

Added win8/winphone8 ReadPixels, Image.WritePixels to mojo graphics.

Tweaked httprequest, removed httpgetter.


***** V68c *****

Added httprequest module - please migrate to this as httpgetter will be removed in V69.

Fixed mac glfw gles20 apps failing to build due to GL_GLEXT_LEGACY define in glfw.h

Fixed xna winphone7/xbox360 builds failing due to FormClosing method.


***** V68b *****

Fixed DataBuffer.PeekString in ascii mode return negative char values.

Fixed glfw shift/ctrl keys not working.

Fixed mojo openal audio panning.

Added ApplicationServices.h include to glfw target main.h for CFUrl.

Fixed html5 'susended' misspelling!


***** V68 *****

Added Mac (iOS and glfw) versions of OpenUrl.

Fixed some reflection bugs causing build errors.

Added PeekString/PokeString to DataBuffer.

Added brl.httpgetter module for ios/android/glfw.


***** V67f *****

Added linux support for JDK_PATH in config.linux.txt.

Fixed broken transcc -modpath arg.

Fixed hex/bin syntax highlighting in Ted.

Added KEY_MENU (android) - check with KeyHit.

Added ANDROID_GAMEPAD_ENABLED for experimental gamepad support.

Added KEY_BACK (android back button) and KEY_CLOSE (glfw/desktop xna window close button). Check for these with KeyHit. Note: XNA KEY_CLOSE pretty dodgy. Clicking close but not actually closing the window seems to put XNA into a weird zombie state, where window has focus etc, but Game.IsActive returns false. Therefore, I'm currently ignoring Game.IsActive for desktop XNA. xbox/wp7 XNA should be a unaffected by this!

Changed #ifdef to #if for TARGET_OS_IPHONE checks in lang.cpp.

Fixed ios apps not installing properly on latest simulator (and attempted to future proof the process a bit).

Removed show-stopping stray back-tick from xnagame.cs.

Cleaned up android back button processing a bit - back button key events no longer eaten by GameView and KEY_ESCAPE/KEY_BACK now dispatched by Activity.onBackPressed() instead.

MODPATH setting added to bin/config.blah.txt config file.


***** V67e *****

Trans now displays version.

Fixed audio sample mem management issues on Win8/WinPhone8.

Implemented OpenUrl on Win8/WinPhone8.

Fixed Flash mojo.graphics transform bug.

Fixed XNA KeyChar bug where both key ups/downs were causing a KeyChar.
 

***** V67d *****

Fixed html5 canvas mouse coords bug.

Added GetScissor(scissor#[]) and GetColor(color#[]).

Stack removals now 'null out' removed items.

Millisecs back to v66 behaviour - ie: starts at 0 when app starts.

Added millisecs to GetDate.


***** v67c *****

Add brl.admob and brl.gamecenter.

Fixed leading 0 on int consts causing octal output bug.

Added #ANDROID_MAINFEST_APPLICATION to allow you to add stuff to the <application> block of manifest, eg: <activity...> for admob.

Added #LIBS to android/ios target - only .jar supported on android (all copied to project 'libs' dir during build) and .h, .a, .framework on ios (all copied to project 'libs' dir, which is by coincidence in project include/lib path) - features unholy hacking of a .pbxproj file.

Fixed preprocessor #If/#Else/#End bug(s).

Fixed issue with blah.const style code where blah was being evaluated even if it had no side effects (eg: if var were a var).

Main() not found now errs out on line 1 of main source file.

Mojo now creates devices just before OnCreate called (instead of in App ctor) so DeviceWidth/DeviceHeight etc can init themselves properly.
 
Fixed Stream.Skip offset/count param order.

CreateImage on flash now creates transparent image.

Android accelerometer now allows for device orientation.


***** V67b *****

Added SetScissor to win8 targets.

Ted changes: centered find scrolling; http:// links in docs now open in external browser.

Added some rectangle/array error checking to DrawImageRect, ReadPixels, Image.WritePixels.

'monkeytarget' module now always imported - targets should always include a monkeytarget module, even if it's a NOP. No top-level monkeytarget modules outside of targets please!

Print now a NOP in win8/winphone8 so apps validate - will fix.

Fixed the winphone8 target project ARM settings.

Refactored the new target stuff.

Fixed the reflection bug in transcc.


***** V67a *****

BIG CHANGES!

Mojo app and input modules are now pure Monkey.

brl.game declares native BBGame class for targets to implement.

Extern static class member functions must no longer be 'pre-munged'.

Added HideMouse/ShowMouse/OpenUrl to mojo.app which will no doubt clash with 3rd party efforts.

Renamed trans to transcc.

Majorly overhauled target system! Target dirs now contain:

TARGET.MONKEY - target control file
template/ - template project to be copied to app.build folder when target built.
modules/ - modules specific to target.

TARGET.MONKEY should contain 3 decls:

TARGET_NAME="Glfw Game"		'name of target to appear in IDE combo box and to be used with Transcc.
TARGET_SYSTEM="glfw"		'target system - this ends up in app config TARGET var.
TARGET_BUILDER="glfw"		'builder to use for target, same as system for now.

You can now 'copy' a target simply by copying a target dir and changing TARGET_NAME. Target builders are hardcoded into transcc.

Added new 'game' module to brl that declares a low level BBGame class. This is roughly equivalent to the App/Input bits of old Mojo and is implemented by new targets - see bananas/mak/bbgametest.

Majorly overhauled Mojo! Mojo native code now contains graphics/audio code only. App/input stuff is now pure Monkey and based on brl.game BBGame class.

Added ResetInput to mojo.input.

Added win8 and winphone8 targets and win8 system/builder.

Added win8 mojo module.

opengl.databuffer removed - opengl module now uses brl.databuffer instead.

glfw updated to 2.7.7

Flash target now sends Print output to an html textarea via ExternalInterface.

Trancc android builder now captures log output when app is run so you should be able to see android Print statements now. Note that this can leave the .build dir 'locked' by the android system on windows, so you may have to kill the 'ADB' process if you want to delete the .build dir - but I think it's worth it.

A few tweaks to Ted: Autocaps now disabled inside block rems; kill proc should be faster/ruder; tweaks to proc output so stdout>stderr.


***** V66 *****

Modules

brl - added filestream module.

psm/xna - tweaked update rate logic, should be a bit 'cleaner' now esp. on PSM. Added XNA_VSYNC_ENABLED config var (defaults to false) to XNA. Use this + 60FPS update rate to get 60FPS on WP7.

xna/psm mojo - changed SaveState/LoadState filename to '.mojostate'.


Targets:

Added monkey://internal/ support to glfw, stdcpp, android, ios, xna and psm targets.

Fixed ios view controller orientation issue with ios6.0.


Trans (V1.42):

Improved support for spaces in preprocessor stmts.

ios target now creates a Documents dir on simulator for use by //internal/.


***** V65 *****

Modules:

mojo - Added async loaders.

mojo - fixed dependancies on bool config settings - changed lots of =="true" to =="1".

reflection - no longer sets reflection filter to '*', so by default nothing will be reflected even if you import reflection.

brl.databuffer - android version no longer supports 'direct' ByteBuffers.

Added brl modules: brl.asyncevent, brl.asyncstream, brl.asynctcpstream, brl.asynctcpconnector, brl.ringbuffer.


Targets:

Updated GLFW to 2.7.6 for Mac joypad support - added IOKit framework to glfw xcode project.

Converted all CONFIG.TXT files to monkey preprocessor source.


Trans (V1.41):

Target CONFIG.TXT files are now monkey files that are preprocessed only. This means you will need to prefix each CONFIG.TXT line with '#' and enquote params. This is a definite 'delete/update' .build dir change.

Added preprocessor config var += operator, mainly for use with adding reflection filters.

Preprocessor config vars can now be modified, UNTIL they are used - ie: once a config var is evaluated for use with #If, #Print, #Error #blah= etc, it cannot be modified.

Added String.ToChars:Int[]() method.


Ted (1.7):

Added find in files to folder context menu.


***** V64 *****

Modules:

Moved BoxInt, ArrayBoxer etc from reflection to monkey.boxes. Forgot to update docs.

Added brl modules: brl.databuffer, brl.stream, brl.datastream, brl.tcpstream. Haven't retired opengl.databuffer yet.


Targets:

Added mingw support to glfw via CONFIG.TXT setting #GLFW_USE_MINGW="true". Note: Recommended mingw gcc/g++ version is 4.6.1. I tried 4.7.1 but had the occasional random app crash.

Added BINARY_FILES filter to CONFIG.TXT files.

Android - added INTERNET permissions to AndroidManifest.xml template.

Windows glfw - added WinSock lib to msvc project.


Trans (V1.40)

Added mingw support to glfw.

Added BINARY_FILES handling.


***** V63 *****

Modules:

mojo.graphics - Added CreateImage, ReadPixels, Image.WritePixels.

android mojo.graphics - Fixed ancient 'textures don't render first time' bug!


Targets:

pss target - removed.


Trans (V1.39)

Removed pss target.


***** V62 *****

Modules:

android mojo - MOJO_HICOLOR_TEXTURES config setting now actually does something! Set to "true" for 32 bit textures, "false" for 16 bit. Yep, I know it's badly named, HICOLOR used to mean '16bit'. Only applies to Android.

c++ monkey.lang - LoadString now assumes UTF-8 by default (ie: if there's no BOM) and SaveString now saves (BOM-less) UTF-8 too. NOTE: This is pretty much the standard, and most targets assume UTF-8 like this. Ted also now behaves this way - ie: source files are assumed to be UTF-8 unless there's a BOM. You may have issues with files saved from Monk, which does not UTF-encode files (or write a BOM marker) unless the file contains at least one char >255. This means files saved from Monk with 'accented' euro-chars (which are <256) may not be UTF-encoded, and you'll have problems loading such files into Ted or using LoadString. I may eventually add a 'file encoding' option to Ted to deal with this but in the meantime you'll have to copy 'n' paste around it. One trick would be to paste a single 'Asian' char into a source file in Monk before saving which will trigger UTF-encoding.

flash mojo - kludged around paused/resumed audio not looping from start issue. Not pretty, and seems to have increased loop lag a tad but wotkanyado.

c++ monkey.lang - fixed bug when resizing arrays of arrays.


Targets:

glfw - added *.ogg to SOUND_FILES and MUSIC_FILES in target CONFIG.TXT.

android - LoadString now assumes UTF-8 by default (ie: if there's no BOM).


Trans (V1.38)

Rebuilt for UTF-8 tweaks.


Ted (V1.6)

Added help index.


***** V61b ******

Modules:

pss/psm mojo - added discard to surface.

flash mojo - fixed stream of mousehits bug when app lost/regained focus.

glfw mojo - added KEY_TILDE and KEY_QUOTES support.

lang.cpp - tweaked GC, added CPP_GC_MARK_RATE and CPP_GC_TRIGGER config vars.


Targets:

Upgared Mac ios and glfw target projects to xcode4.4.

Added psm target - will replace pss target in next release so upgrade NOW! Check your PSM_PATH in bin/config.winnt.txt is set correctly before use.

glfw - Updated GLFW lib to 2.7.5


Trans (V1.37):

Fixed debug array index check bugs on js/as.

Fixed bug with reflection filter and mixed cased module names.

Added debug info to c++ translator.


***** V58 *****

Modules:

mojo - Added (highly) experimental pss support!

opengl - Fixed leak in c++ LoadImageData.

Targets:

Pss - Added! Added config var PSS_PATH="${PROGRAMFILES}\SCE\Pss" to bin\config.winnt.txt

Android - MonkeyData.loadString now uses StringBuilder instead of StringBuffer.


Trans (v1.34):

Fixed some error line bugs.


***** V57 *****

Modules:

xna mojo - scissor rect now clipped to device rect.

Fixed Alias with primtive Int, Float, String types, eg: Alias MyInt=Int,MyString=String etc.


***** V56b *****

Added app config var MOJO_AUTO_SUSPEND_ENABLED (defaults to false) to auto suspend app if it loses input focus. Apps always auto-suspend if minimized. Doesn't apply to ios/android.


Trans (v1.32)

Fixed iOS target so it's xcode 4.3.1 aware - NOTE: you will also have to run this from the command line after installing xcode 4.3.1:

sudo /usr/bin/xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app


***** V55 *****

Modules:

reflection - added recursive? flag to ClassInfo methods GetConst(s), GetGlobal(s), GetField(s), GetMethod(s) and GetFunction(s).

Trans (v1.30):

Fixed bool boxing.

Fixed reflection filter (pt 1 no doubt).

Reflection support added!

XNA builds now only build Windows version - much faster than building both Windows/XBOX!

Added more flexible interface casting - interfaces can now be cast to and from ANY class/interface. I thought this choked AS, but now doesn't seem to...

Fixed C++ cast-interface-to-object bug.

Fixed glfw minimize window bug.

Fixed html5 lost mouseup event by simulating mouseup when mouse leaves canvas - not ideal, any better ideas most welcome.

Added glfw target for 'native' apps - use glfw API for OS, OpenAL for Audio, stb_image for images...only windows for now...requires vc2010

Resurrected 'Strict' mode!

Added 'strict', 'void' to keywords in toker.

iPhone gxtk target added.

Added TouchX#( index ),TouchY#( index ),TouchDown( index ) and TouchHit( index ).
